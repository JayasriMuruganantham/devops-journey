# Week 1: Linux Basics & Git Practice

## Overview
This week I set up **WSL Ubuntu** on Windows and practiced basic Linux commands, file permissions, and Git/GitHub for version control. A mini Bash script was created for automation, and all outputs were tracked in `.txt` files.

## Environment Setup
- **WSL Ubuntu Version 2** installed
- System updated:
```bash
